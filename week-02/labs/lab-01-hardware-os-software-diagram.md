# Week 2 Lab — Cybersecurity Landscape & Digital Infrastructure Overview

**Student Name:** Raeme McElroy

**Date Completed:** 9/28/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 2  
**Submission Path:** `week-02/labs/lab-01-hardware-os-software-diagram.md`

---

## Overview

In this lab, you build a working mental model of the system you'll be securing throughout this course: the hardware, operating system, and software layers that make up every computer, and where the cybersecurity field fits around them. This lab has two parts. Part A connects this week's material to the CyberFoundations City map. Part B has you build and explain a diagram of how a computer's hardware, OS, and software layers interact.

**No terminal or command line is required this week** — that starts in Week 3.

## Lab Environment

| Required Materials | CyberFoundations City map; a diagram tool of your choice (hand-drawn and photographed, or any digital tool) |

**Prerequisite:** Portfolio repo created from the CyberFoundations student template in Week 1. This file is already in your repo at `week-02/labs/lab-01-hardware-os-software-diagram.md`, ready to fill in.

## Part A — CyberFoundations City & the Cybersecurity Landscape

The CyberFoundations City map is your visual guide to the next 11 weeks. Each district represents a module of this course. This part connects this week's material to the map you were introduced to in Week 1.

### Step 1 — Open the Lab Portal Orientation Module

Log into the Lab Portal with your Microsoft account. From your Student Dashboard, open the **Module 1 orientation** module.

### Step 2 — Complete the Orientation Walkthrough

Work through the orientation content. It covers the same hardware/OS/software material as this week's lessons from a different angle — use it to check your understanding, not to replace the lessons.

### Step 3 — Locate This Week's District on the City Map

Open the CyberFoundations City map (introduced in Week 1, Lesson 6). Identify which district corresponds to Module 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI.

**District name:** Foundry District

```
Foundry District
```

**Why this district fits this week's topics (1–2 sentences):**

```
This district fits this week's topic because the cybersecurity landscape is the full picture of who's building digital systems, who's attacking them, and how the two sides constantly adapt to each other.
```

## Part B — Hardware, OS, and Software Diagram

A computer is a stack of layers: physical hardware at the bottom, an operating system managing that hardware in the middle, and the software you actually use on top. This part has you draw that stack and explain it in your own words.

### Step 1 — Identify the Layers

Before drawing anything, list the three layers you'll diagram and one example of what lives at each layer.

**Hardware layer — one example component:** Motherboard

```
(e.g., CPU, RAM, storage — your choice)
```

**Operating system layer — name an OS:** Windows

```
(e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
```

**Software layer — one example application:** Google Chrome

```
(e.g., a web browser, a word processor)
```

### Step 2 — Sketch Your Diagram

Sketch a simple diagram (hand-drawn and photographed, or built in any digital tool) showing how the hardware, OS, and software layers stack and interact. Arrows or labels showing "what talks to what" matter more than visual polish. If you'd like a free browser-based option instead of hand-drawing, try [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) — no account required to get started.

### Step 3 — Upload and Embed Your Diagram

Upload your diagram image directly into your repo's assets folder — keep it there rather than pasting it loose into this file, so all of this week's images stay together and organized.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-02/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in your diagram image, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces, no timestamps — e.g. `hardware-os-software-diagram.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and paste that link into the embed line below, in place of the placeholder:

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

### Step 4 — Explain Your Diagram

In your own words — not a copied definition — explain how the three layers interact. Reference your own diagram directly.

```
Google Chrome communicates with Windows, and Windows manages/interacts with the hardware. I included two-way arrows because information can flow back up between layers.
```

## Analysis Questions

Answer each question in your own words. These questions connect what you did in Parts A and B to the bigger picture of this course.

### Analysis Question 1

If the operating system crashed on the computer you diagrammed, which layer(s) would stop working, and which (if any) would keep working? Explain your reasoning.

```
If Windows crashed, the software layer would stop working because Google Chrome depends on the operating system to run. The motherboard would still physically work, but without Windows functioning, the hardware and software would not be able to communicate properly.
```

### Analysis Question 2

Pick one piece of software you use daily. Trace it down through the OS to the hardware it ultimately depends on. What would happen to that software if the hardware layer failed?

```
One piece of software I use daily is Google Chrome. Chrome runs through the Windows operating system, which communicates with the computer's hardware, including the motherboard, CPU, and memory. If the hardware layer failed, Chrome would not be able to run because Windows and the software depend on the hardware to process information and perform their functions.
```

### Analysis Question 3

Explain, in your own words, why a cybersecurity professional needs to understand all three layers — hardware, OS, and software — rather than just the software layer where most visible attacks (like phishing emails) happen.

```
A cybersecurity professional needs to understand all three layers because a security issue can affect more than just the software. Even if an attack starts at the software layer, like a phishing email, it could lead to changes in the operating system or give an attacker access to data and other resources on the computer. Understanding the hardware, operating system, and software helps cybersecurity professionals understand how an attack can move through a system, identify where the problem is, and determine how to protect or fix it.

## Lab Report Questions

Answer each question in complete sentences.

**1. What is the cybersecurity landscape, and why does it matter to someone starting this course?**

```
The cybersecurity landscape includes attackers, defenders, infrastructure, and everyday users who interact with digital systems. It also includes the growing attack surface, which is every possible point an attacker could use to gain access to a system. This matters to someone starting this course because understanding the cybersecurity landscape helps us understand what we are protecting, who we are protecting it from, and where vulnerabilities may exist.
```

**2. Which CyberFoundations City district did you identify in Part A, and how does its theme connect to the hardware/OS/software material in Part B?**

```
I identified the Foundry District in Part A. Its theme connects to the hardware, operating system, and software material because digital systems are built from multiple connected layers that depend on each other. Understanding how those layers interact helps us see why there are multiple areas that need to be protected and why the cybersecurity landscape becomes more complex as more systems are connected.
```

**3. Of the three layers (hardware, OS, software), which one do you think is hardest to secure, and why?**

```
I think the software layer is the hardest to secure because software is constantly being updated, new vulnerabilities can be discovered, and users interact with applications every day. Each application can also create another possible point of entry for an attacker, which increases the attack surface. Even with security protections in place, user actions such as clicking a phishing link or downloading something malicious can create additional risks.
```
